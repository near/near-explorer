# NEAR Explorer CLI

This is an UNSTABLE convenience tool which helps to make some routine calls to NEAR Explorer
Backend.

This CLI uses internal APIs which are not really meant for public use, but we still need to query
some information once in a while, so here is the convenience tool to do that.

## Setup

Install NPM dependencies:

```
$ npm install
```

## Usage

Run `./bin/near-explorer` without parameters to get a help message with all the available
parameters.

The common example of querying the production testnet NEAR Explorer:

```
$ ./bin/near-explorer query
```

Then enter an SQL query. Common SQL queries:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM nodes;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM transactons;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM blocks;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM accounts;
SELECT * FROM transactions WHERE block_hash = '...';
SELECT * FROM transactions LEFT JOIN blocks ON blocks.hash = transactions.block_hash ORDER BY blocks.height DESC LIMIT 10;
SELECT * FROM transactions WHERE signerId = 'test.near' OR receiverId = 'test.near';
```

SECURITY NOTE: The API is read-only, so you cannot modify the state (UPDATE, DELETE, DROP, ...).
However, you still can come up with a complex query which will lead to DoS (deny of service).
Please, be mindful. We are going to address this in the future generation of NEAR Explorer
Backend, though, most certainly, there won't be such a freedom as passing raw SQL queries.

NOTE: You can learn about the DB structure from the models defined in `./backend/models/`.

You can specify `--endpoint` and `--chain-id` if you want to query other backends.

To query `staging` network data running on production NEAR Explorer:

```
$ ./bin/near-explorer --chain-id staging query
```

To query a locally running NEAR Explorer backend (WAMP):

```
$ ./bin/near-explorer --endpoint http://localhost:8080/ws --chain-id localhostnet query
```
